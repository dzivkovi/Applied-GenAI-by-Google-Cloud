    "      - Datastores from web sites, BigQuery Tables, GCS Buckets, and much more!\n",
    "- Ask a question\n",
    "  - Query the datastore using the Python Client API\n",
    "  - API will search the datastore for related information in the documents using vector similarity\n",
    "  - Retrieve the content associated from Datastore\n",
    "  - Prepare a prompt to answer the question using the retrieved search results as context\n",
    "- Present the response as an answer with links to the related documents (sections of the document(s)).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is Unique?**\n",
    "\n",
    "An LLM is likely unexposed to a users private content.  This appoach constructs a summarization prompt for an LLM by first retriving context for the question from the users documents using Vertex AI Search datastores as the source.  This also allows the response to be accompanied by direct reference to the users documentation used in the prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "- An LLM is likely trained on many sources that probably include lots of general knowledge, even information like what is used here.  It is also likely knowledgable of past outdated information which can be a benefit - or detriment - to accuracy.  This approach directly uses the version of the document that currently applies.\n",
